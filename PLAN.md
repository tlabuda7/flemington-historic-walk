# Flemington Main Street, c. 1920 — VR Walkthrough

## Goal

A walkable VR reconstruction of Main Street in Flemington, NJ as it looked around 1920,
built with A-Frame (WebXR) and viewed on a Meta Quest 2 (via Quest Link from a PC) or in
Chrome on the desktop. The street should feel like a warm, hazy small-town afternoon, with
the Hunterdon County Courthouse and the Union Hotel as the two landmarks.

Scope decisions:
- Buildings are real 3D models (not just textured boxes) so porches, verandas, steps and
  rooflines read correctly. Exteriors only: no interiors.
- Auxiliary buildings (sheds, stables, auto garages, ice houses and other outbuildings behind
  the main buildings) should eventually match the 1921 Sanborn map.

Decisions (2026-11-02):
- ~~Models are built in code from a kit of parts~~ → superseded: landmarks are built in
  Blender by script with Poly Haven textures and baked lighting (Union Hotel first).
  The code kit (`js/kit.js`) remains for placeholders.
- Start small: the block around the courthouse and the Union Hotel first, then expand.
- Outbuildings on hold. Visitors stay on Main Street (no alleys or side streets).
- Buildings go through the agent pipeline in CLAUDE.md
  (planner → asset-scout → blender-builder → reviewer → scene-integrator), one at a time,
  with user approval of the spec and of the review.
- 2026-11-03: owner is away and asked the orchestrator to keep building and integrating
  buildings without waiting. Specs and reviews are auto-approved for now ("most realistic,
  from the photos"); open questions are settled from the photos and logged under each spec's
  "Orchestrator decisions" for the owner to check later. Order after the courthouse: county
  offices → Wurts law office → bank building → 78 Main → house at 65 Main → 68 Main.
  A building that fails 3 review rounds is parked and skipped.

## Pipeline status

| Building | Spec | Assets | Built | Review | In scene |
|----------|------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Union Hotel (70–76 Main) | done before pipeline | done | done | — | yes |
| Hunterdon County Courthouse (75 Main) | approved | done | done, round-1 fixes applied (13.7k tris, 2.6 MB) | round 2: PASS | yes (GLB, 2026-11-03) |

## Building specs

(Written by the planner agent, one section per building.)

### Hunterdon County Court House (75 Main St)

**Status:** in scene (scene-integrator, 2026-11-03): `#courthouse` at (−18.34, 0.15, −6.85), rotation 0 90 0, GLB + baked lightmap (intensity 1.1979); paved forecourt (x −10.3 … −18.3, z −13.55 … 0) at sidewalk height replaces the lawn path; 15 cm grade slabs under body, north wing and jail yard. No console errors; 160 draw calls / 53k triangles from the start view (149 / 39k before), 66 / 19k facing it from the east sidewalk. Screenshot `assets/models/previews/courthouse-in-scene.png`. Earlier: review round 2: PASS (reviewer, 2026-11-03): all 5 round-1 fixes + rock wall resolved; GLB 13,680 tris, 2.63 MB, 9 × 1K JPG, TEXCOORD_0+1; lightmap 2048², black area 55% → ~20%; loads in the review viewer (intensity 1.1979) with no console errors. Next: show the owner, then scene-integrator. Earlier: round-1 fixes applied (blender-builder, 2026-11-03): front chimney moved to (3.0, 4.6), top 14.2; rear stacks 0.9 × 1.2 m, top 13.9; smoother white paint on columns/trim (`paint_white.jpg`), warm cream stucco (`stucco_cream.jpg`), mid-grey yard wall (`rock_wall_grey.jpg`), made by `tools/prepare_courthouse_paints.py`; hidden faces (podium top, entablature layers, roof underside, interior) removed and lightmap repacked, window holes filled. GLB 13,680 triangles, 12 materials, 2.6 MB; lightmap 2048², LIGHTMAP_SCALE 1.1979. Previews re-rendered. Next: reviewer round 2. Earlier: review round 1: FIXES (reviewer, 2026-11-03): GLB 11,751 tris, 2.70 MB, 9 × 1K JPG, TEXCOORD_0+1, lightmap 2048² all OK; proportions, columns, pediment, cupola, steps match the c.1910 photo. 5 fixes: front chimney overlaps the cupola (1909 view), blotchy grey column texture, walls read cool blue-white not cream, rear chimneys too slender, ~55% of the lightmap wasted on hidden faces. Browser viewer could not be opened (navigation refused), so checked by GLB parse + previews. Next: blender-builder fixes, then review round 2. Earlier: built (blender-builder, 2026-11-03): `assets/models/courthouse.glb` (11,751 triangles, 12 materials, 2.7 MB), `assets/textures/courthouse-lightmap.jpg` (2048², LIGHTMAP_SCALE 1.1169), scripts `tools/blender/courthouse.py` + `courthouse_bake.py` + `courthouse_preview.py`, source `assets/models/source/courthouse.blend`, previews `assets/models/previews/courthouse-*.png`. Next: reviewer. Earlier: assets ready (asset-scout, 2026-11-03): 5 new Poly Haven CC0 1K maps in `assets/textures/courthouse/` — `stucco_offwhite.jpg` (walls, 2.0 m), `brownstone.jpg` (steps/pedestals/base/sills, 2.15 m), `clapboard_buff.jpg` (north wing + yard building, 1.0 m), `rock_wall_08.jpg` (jail-yard wall, 1.8 m), `dome_paint_green.jpg` (cupola dome, 1.0 m); reuse from `polyhaven/`: trim_paint_cream, roof_slates_03, red_brick, door_paint_green, weathered_planks/wood_table_worn (metal_plate_02 not needed). Logged in SOURCES.md. Next: blender-builder. (Spec approved by owner 2026-11-03; planner 2026-11-02, cross-checked 2026-11-03.)

**Owner decisions (2026-11-03, settled from the photos)** — these override anything below:
1. Main roof: dark grey slate (barely visible from the street; no photo shows it as tin).
   Cupola dome: painted sheet metal, muted green (the 1909 tinted postcard shows a green dome;
   HABS shows it ribbed metal).
2. Walls: warm off-white painted stucco, slightly cream (c.1910 and 1909 views), with grime.
3. Eaves and rake: paired scroll brackets as in the c.1910 dead-on photo (not the later plain
   modillion blocks seen in HABS).
4. Jail yard: include the stone wall and small yard building behind, low detail.
5. No window bars — no photo shows any.
6. Fire-alarm post: include as a simple low-poly prop at the map's F.A. spot.
7. Rear chimneys: three on each roof slope (HABS shows the south slope, the 1909 postcard
   the north slope). Back wall and wing roof stay simple guesses.

**Placement** (west side, front faces east onto Main St)
- Entity position = centre of the portico front line: **(−18.34, y, −6.85)**, `rotation="0 90 0"`
  (placeholder was (−17.8, 0, −7.05); move it). Front line 8.0 m behind the Main St property
  line (x −10.3). Steps project 1.65 m further, to x ≈ −16.7.
- Body front wall x −22.77, rear wall x −43.24; south wall z −0.16 (on the Court St line);
  north wall z −13.55.
- Blender local frame (front −Y, origin at portico front, **+X = north**): portico y 0 … 4.43;
  body x −6.70 … +6.70, y 4.43 … 24.91; north wing x +6.70 … +10.50, y 5.11 … 12.93;
  jail yard x −6.69 … +8.75, y 24.91 … 36.2.
- z = 0 in Blender = foot of the steps (forecourt level). See integrator notes for y.

**Massing**
- Body: 13.40 m wide × 20.48 m deep (map), 2 storeys, eaves/cornice top **9.0 m** above the
  forecourt (map "30'" = 9.1 m; photo 9.0 m). Ground floor (jail) 1.10 → 4.3 m, courtroom floor
  4.3 → 7.45 m (photo/HABS estimate).
- Roof: front-to-back gable, ridge 13.1 m (pediment rise 4.1 m over 6.7 m half-span ≈ 31°,
  photo 1910 + HABS), eaves overhang 0.6 m on the sides. Same closed pediment at the rear (guess).
- Portico: full width (13.4 m) × 4.43 m deep (map), floor (podium top) at **1.10 m**
  (photo, 6 risers); the portico shares the main roof — pediment and roof run forward over it.
- Base course: brownstone water table 1.10 m high round the body (1909 colour photo), flush with
  the podium.
- North wing ("jail kitchen"): 1 storey frame, 3.8 m (N–S) × 7.8 m (E–W), eave 3.4 m, low shed
  roof falling to the north from 4.2 m at the body wall (photo 1909, estimate). The inner 1.04 m
  strip against the body is stone (map) — stucco it like the body, same roof.
- Jail yard (low detail): stone wall 6.1 m high ("20'"), 0.6 m thick, on the yard's north,
  west and south (Court St) sides; 2-storey frame building in the yard's SE corner, 5.0 × 6.3 m,
  eave 6.0 m, low gable (map; form is a guess).

**Elevation details (1920 state)**
- **Columns**: 4, evenly spaced, centres at x = ±2.04 and ±6.13 (spacing 4.09 m), centre
  y = 0.58. Shafts **unfluted**, Doric/Tuscan, base diameter 0.90 m tapering to 0.78 m, from
  1.55 to 7.30 m; simple capital (echinus 0.15 + square abacus 1.05 × 0.15) to 7.45 m. Each
  stands on a **dark brownstone pedestal** 1.15 m square × 0.45 m high (1.10 → 1.55).
- **Entablature** (front and round all sides) 7.45 → 9.0 m: architrave 0.55, frieze 0.65,
  cornice 0.35 with 0.6 m overhang. In the frieze: **pairs of large scroll brackets** above each
  column (4 pairs, the corner pairs wrapping the corners) and small block modillions at ~0.6 m
  between them; same brackets in pairs every ~4 m along the side frieze. Small rectangular
  datestone (1.0 × 0.35 m) centred in the frieze.
- **Pediment**: stuccoed tympanum with **two** 6-light windows (0.9 × 1.1 m, sill 10.0 m,
  centres x ±2.3). Raking cornice with 3 pairs of pendant scroll brackets per side plus small
  modillions between. No oculus.
- **Front wall** (under the portico, y = 4.43), 3 bays: centre **round-arched doorway** 1.85 m
  wide, crown 3.85 m (spring 2.92), fanlight with radiating bars, double 6-panel doors (sidelights
  per NRHP, may be omitted — in deep shadow in 1910); side bays at x ±3.7: ground windows
  1.1 × 1.8 (sill 2.0), second-floor windows 1.1 × 1.9 (sill 4.45) over the door too, and small
  attic lights 0.9 × 0.6 (sill 6.55) above the side second-floor windows (HABS; dark in 1910).
  6/6 double-hung sash, **dark-painted sash and frames** (1910 photo), plain stucco surrounds,
  thin stone sills. Flat plastered portico ceiling at 7.45 m. Flat stucco antae 0.6 m wide at
  the front-wall corners.
- **Steps**: brownstone, full width between the outer pedestals and running past them
  (13.0 m), 6 risers × 0.183 m, treads 0.30 m, projecting to y = −1.65. No handrails in 1920.
- **Side walls** (both): front 3.5 m blank, then 5 bays at 3.2 m, window centres
  y ≈ 9.0, 12.2, 15.4, 18.6, 21.8 (HABS + 1930s photo). Ground floor 1.0 × 1.8 (sill 2.0) with
  vertical iron bars (jail — guess); second floor taller 1.0 × 2.6 (sill 4.4). On the north side
  the wing hides the first two ground-floor bays. Corner pilasters as on the front.
- **Rear wall** (guess, not visible from Main St): 3 bays of the same windows, plain pediment
  without brackets, one attic window.
- **Chimneys**, red brick, 0.8 × 0.6 m, corbelled cap: **south slope 3** at y ≈ 15, 18.5, 22
  rising ~1 m inside the eave line to 14.6 m (HABS/1930s); **north slope 3** matching at the
  rear plus **1 front chimney** just north of the cupola at (x +1.5, y 8), top 15.0 m (1906–09
  photos; gone by the 1960s).
- **Cupola** (centre x 0, y 6.5, over the front of the roof): square stuccoed base 3.0 m
  from the roof to 13.9 m; **octagonal** frame drum 2.8 m across flats, 13.9 → 16.3 m, with a
  round-arched louvred opening (1.0 × 1.6 m) in each of the 8 faces and corner pilasters;
  moulded cornice 0.35 m; **dome** (slightly bell-shaped, ribbed at the 8 corners) 16.65 → 18.1 m;
  ball finial 0.35 m and iron spike/weathervane to ~19.4 m. (Height checked against 1910 photo
  with perspective.)
- **North wing**: east face (y 5.11) with a 4-pane-high window 1.4 × 1.2 and a plain door
  0.9 × 2.1 under a shed hood (0.6 m deep, at 2.7 m); clapboard 0.1 m exposure, corner boards.
- No signage beyond the datestone. No flagpole, lamps or railings on the building in 1920.

**Materials & colours (1920)**
- Walls, antae, tympanum: lime stucco on stone, painted **warm off-white / pale grey**
  (≈ #E6E1D4); columns, entablature, brackets, cupola: painted wood/stucco, brighter white
  (≈ #F2EFE6).
- Steps, pedestals, base course, sills: **brownstone**, red-brown (≈ #6E4A3C).
- Roof: dark grey **slate** (guess, see questions). Cupola dome: painted sheet metal,
  dark grey-green. Chimneys: red brick, unpainted.
- Sash/frames: dark green-black paint; doors dark varnished brown or the hotel's green.
- North wing: clapboard painted dull buff-brown (1909 colour, guess), dark trim.
- Jail-yard wall: grey rubble fieldstone.
- Textures — reuse: `trim_paint_cream.jpg` (columns/trim, 2 m), `roof_slates_03.jpg` (3 m),
  `red_brick.jpg` (chimneys, 1.4 m), `metal_plate_02.jpg` (dome, tinted, 2 m),
  `door_paint_green.jpg` (doors, 0.8 m), `weathered_planks.jpg`/`wood_table_worn.jpg` as needed.
  **New for asset-scout** (Poly Haven CC0, 1K colour): (1) smooth painted stucco/plaster,
  off-white, tile ~3 m; (2) brownstone / red sandstone (smooth or ashlar), tile ~1.5 m;
  (3) painted wooden clapboard/siding, tile ~2 m; (4) rough grey fieldstone/rubble wall, tile ~3 m.

**Weathering**: stucco slightly streaked below sills, under the cornice and at chimney stacks;
greenish-grey damp staining just above the brownstone base; brownstone treads worn and darker in
the middle; chalky paint on the column bases; soot at chimney tops; light rust streaks on the dome.
Keep it a cared-for public building — subtler than the hotel.

**Budget**: target ~22k triangles, hard cap 30k (landmark). Columns 32 sides; brackets as
low-poly profile extrusions; jail-yard wall and yard building < 1k together. 5 reused + 4 new
1K colour textures, one 2K lightmap `assets/textures/courthouse-lightmap.jpg`. GLB ≤ 5 MB:
`assets/models/courthouse.glb`; scripts `tools/blender/courthouse.py` + `courthouse_bake.py`.

**Acceptance checks for the reviewer**
1. Four unfluted columns, evenly spaced across the full 13.4 m front, on dark brownstone
   pedestals; no railings.
2. Pediment has exactly **two** windows and paired scroll brackets on the raking cornice;
   paired brackets over each column in the frieze.
3. Front wall: 3 bays, round-arched centre door, windows on two floors each side.
4. Eaves top 9.0 m ± 0.3 above the step foot; ridge ≈ 13.1 m; pediment pitch ≈ 31°.
5. Octagonal cupola with arched openings and a dome + finial, sitting over the front part of
   the roof (centre ~6.5 m behind the portico front), dome top ≈ 18 m.
6. Body footprint 13.4 × 20.5 m behind a 4.4 m portico; brownstone steps (6 risers) in front.
7. Red brick chimneys: 3 at the rear on each slope + 1 beside the cupola on the north slope.
8. One-storey frame wing on the north side (+X), starting ~0.7 m behind the front wall.
9. Walls off-white stucco, trim white, base/steps red-brown; ≤ 30k triangles. With the WSW
   sun the east front is in shade: the portico and front wall must still read (bounce light,
   not black), and the sunlit south side shows window reveals and chimney shadows.
10. Model origin at the centre of the portico front at step-foot level; front faces −Y.

**Integrator notes (scene, not the model)**
- Move `#courthouse` to (−18.34, y, −6.85). Photos show a **paved forecourt** (no lawn) in
  front of the courthouse: replace the lawn path at (−13.05, −7.05) with paving from the steps
  (x −16.7) to the property line (x −10.3), z ≈ −13.6 … −0.2; set entity y to that paving level
  (0.15 if flush with the sidewalk, as the hotel).
- Curb trees at (−7, −2.6) and (−7, −11.5) match the 1906–1912 views (young trees at the curb);
  keep them. A telegraph pole stood at the curb by the north corner (1910).
- Drinking fountain (rough granite block ~1.6 m with a horse-head medallion, round basin, globe
  lamp on top): 1909 photo puts it at the sidewalk by the north wing, in front of the county
  offices; separate prop later.
- `lawn-west` must not show through the jail-yard / courthouse footprint.

**Differences 1905–1912 vs. HABS 1960s** (build the earlier state): 1960s has plain modillion
cornice (no scroll brackets), 3 + 2 pediment windows, white sash, handrails and cheek walls on the
steps, a hanging lantern, no front chimney, the 1925 stone jail behind, flagpole; trees gone.

**Open questions / guesses**
1. Roof: dark slate (recommended) or painted tin (the 1908 colour card shows it green)?
2. Wall colour: warm off-white painted stucco (recommended) vs. natural grey stucco?
3. Brackets vs. plain modillions: the brackets are documented 1905–1912 but gone by the 1930s;
   the change date is unknown. Recommend brackets (closest photos to 1920).
4. Include the jail-yard 20' stone wall and the yard building (recommended, low detail) or stop at
   the courthouse body?
5. Iron bars on the ground-floor side windows (jail) — guess; keep or drop?
6. "F.A." circle on the map at the portico's SE corner (scene (−17.4, −2.9)) — probably a fire-alarm
   post; the 1905–08 cards show a stone post with a lamp near there. Model it as a prop or ignore?
7. Rear (west) wall and the north wing's exact roof form are not visible in any photo — guesses.
8. Rear chimneys: 3 on each slope (spec) or 3 in total on the north side? (cross-check above)

**Cross-check (second planner pass, 2026-11-02; independent re-measurement, no web access)**
Confirms the spec above within ~0.1 m: map body px x 2968–3361, y 6640–6895 (13.3 × 20.5 m),
portico front px 3443 → entity (−18.44, −6.90) vs (−18.34, −6.85) above — keep the spec's
value. Front proportions from the 1910 dead-on card (0.031 m/px) agree: eaves 9.1 m, columns
evenly spaced at ~4.1 m with the outer ones at the corners, column base Ø ≈ 0.9 m, door 1.85 m
wide with crown ≈ 3.2 m above the portico floor, front bays at x ±3.6. Points the builder should
take from this pass:
- **Pediment windows are taller than above**: 1910 card gives ≈ 0.95 × 1.5 m with sills just
  above the horizontal cornice (≈ 9.3–9.4 m), centres x ±2.1. Use 0.95 × 1.45, sill 9.4.
- **Front chimney**: in the 1906/1908 NE views it stands directly in front of the cupola base,
  i.e. north-*east* of the cupola. Put it at about (x +1.5, y 5.0), not y 8.
- **Rear chimneys**: the NE views (1909) show 3 along the north side, the SE views (1930s, HABS)
  show 3 above the south eave. These may be the same three tall stacks seen across the roof, or
  two rows. The spec's 3 + 3 is a guess; 3 in total on the north slope is equally plausible
  (see open question 8).
- Podium: the 1910 card reads ≈ 0.93 m (5 risers); the spec's 1.10 m / 6 risers is within the
  photo's error — keep 1.10 (HABS shows more steps), but check the column pedestals don't
  look stubby.
- Side ground-floor windows: the 1930s SE card suggests sills nearer 1.4 m than 2.0 m;
  keep 2.0 under the jail-bars guess.
- The south wall sits on the Court St line, so the whole south side is seen from Main St
  (looking down Court St): give it the same window detail as the front, not "simpler".

## Constraints

- A-Frame from a CDN, plain HTML/JS. No build tools or frameworks.
- Quest 2 budget: aim for under ~100 draw calls and ~100k triangles on screen.
- Textures: JPG/WebP, 512–1024 px on the long side (2048 only for landmarks), powers of two where possible.
- Models: glTF/GLB, Draco- or meshopt-compressed, one material per model where possible.
- No real-time shadows; bake lighting into textures if needed.

Buildings are named `bldg-w01`–`bldg-w08` (west side, north to south) and
`bldg-e01`–`bldg-e08` (east side, north to south). North is -Z.

## Build steps

1. [x] Scene skeleton: dirt road, wooden sidewalks, placeholder buildings, sky, haze, lighting.
2. [x] Movement: WASD + mouse on desktop; thumbstick walk + snap turn in VR; Enter VR button.
3. [ ] Research: gather 1915–1925 photos, Sanborn fire-insurance maps, and postcards of Main Street.
4. [~] Layout pass: adjust building widths, heights and order to match the Sanborn map.
       Done for Bloomfield Ave–Court St (starter block) and the east side to Higgins Ave.
5. [ ] Facade photos: crop/straighten a photo per building, set `photo:` on each.
6. [~] Landmarks: built in code with the kit (`js/kit.js`, `js/landmarks.js`). Done: Union Hotel,
       courthouse, county offices, Wurts law office, house at 65 Main. Still plain blocks:
       Bank Building (56–66), 68 and 78 Main, 57 Main.
7. [ ] Ground textures: replace procedural dirt and planks with real tiling textures.
8. [ ] Props: telegraph poles, hitching posts, a few period cars/wagons, street lamps (use instancing).
9. [ ] Audio: low-volume ambient loop, positional sounds near landmarks.
10. [ ] Information points: short captions about each building's history.
11. [ ] Performance pass on the Quest 2 (check draw calls, frame rate, texture sizes).
12. [ ] Optional: host on HTTPS (e.g. GitHub Pages) to open directly in the Quest browser without Link.

## Progress log

| Date       | Change |
|------------|--------|
| 2026-11-01 | Project set up: A-Frame 1.6.0 scene with dirt road, plank sidewalks, 16 placeholder buildings, courthouse and hotel lots, gradient sky, warm fog and lighting, desktop and VR movement. Folder structure, PLAN.md, git repo. |
| 2026-11-01 | Saved 7 reference photos from West Jersey History to `assets/photos/reference/` (see SOURCES.md). |
| 2026-11-02 | Saved 1921 Sanborn map sheets 2 and 3 (Library of Congress) to `assets/maps/`. The courthouse (75 Main, west side) and Union Hotel (76 Main, east side) face each other at Court St. |
| 2026-11-02 | Saved 25 more period photos (1905–1915) of the Union Hotel, courthouse, county buildings, bank and post office from West Jersey History, plus 7 HABS survey photos (Library of Congress) to `assets/photos/reference/habs/`. |
| 2026-11-02 | Starter block built. Added the building kit (`js/kit.js`) and modelled landmarks (`js/landmarks.js`). Street re-laid from the map: Main St 66 ft wide, real positions and setbacks for the courthouse, county offices, Wurts office, 65 Main, Union Hotel, Bank Building, 68 and 78 Main; Bloomfield Ave and Court St openings; lawns and front paths on the west side. Map-sized placeholders beyond the block. 103 draw calls, ~3.9k triangles. Guesses: style of 65 Main and the houses south of Court St; street width north of Bloomfield. |
| 2026-11-02 | Switched landmark modelling to Blender (MCP for Blender). Union Hotel built by script `tools/blender/union_hotel.py`: recessed arched windows, bracketed cornice, mansard with dormers, end towers, curved central pavilion with sign, two-storey veranda with turned posts, arcade, balustrade and spindle frieze. ~26k triangles. Saved `assets/models/source/union_hotel.blend`, preview `assets/models/previews/union_hotel.png`. Not yet exported to the scene. |
| 2026-11-02 | Union Hotel made realistic: Poly Haven CC0 textures (brick, painted trim, weathered planks, slate, tin, concrete, wood), warm late-afternoon sun + sky baked with Cycles into a 2K lightmap (shadows, bounce, AO) with a grime mask, rendered unlit in A-Frame by the new `baked-lighting` component. `tools/blender/union_hotel_bake.py` → `assets/models/union-hotel.glb` (26.4k triangles, 8 × 1K textures). Fixed Quest thumbstick walking (oculus-touch-controls). |
| 2026-11-02 | From the 1920s photos: hotel doors rebuilt (white frame, fanlight with radiating bars, panelled grey-green double doors); street trees (`tools/blender/street_tree.py`, 464 triangles) in a row before the hotel and along the west side; pale paved macadam road and scored concrete sidewalks with stone curbs replace the dirt road and plank walks. Not yet committed. Photo-to-map reference page started (all 39 photos viewed), paused. |
| 2026-11-02 | Agent pipeline set up: `.claude/agents/` (planner, asset-scout, blender-builder, reviewer, scene-integrator), rules in CLAUDE.md, review viewer `tools/review/viewer.html`. |
| 2026-11-03 | planner (second pass): independent cross-check of the courthouse spec appended to its section (map and 1910 card re-measured; corrections to pediment windows, front chimney position; rear-chimney count questioned). Spec still awaiting approval. |
| 2026-11-02 | Planner: courthouse build spec written (Sanborn sheet 2 re-measured, 12 photos compared, NRHP/Preservation NJ/Goodspeed sources). New position (−18.34, y, −6.85). Awaiting user approval. |
| 2026-11-03 | scene-integrator: rebuilt street tree integrated (`assets/models/street-tree.glb`, 896 triangles: bark, root flare, soil pit with granite edging). 12 trees moved to x = ±7.5 (builder suggested ±7.3, but at the varied scales the 1.44 m pit then crossed the curb's inner edge at ±6.64), y = 0.175 so the soil isn't hidden by the 0.15 sidewalk, rotations 0/90/180/270 so the pits line up with the street. Tested: no console errors, all trees and the baked-lit hotel load; 87 draw calls / 37.6k triangles from the street. Committed with the hotel door rebuild, roads, sidewalks, curbs, tree assets and agent pipeline files. |
| 2026-11-03 | scene-integrator: Hunterdon County Court House GLB integrated (`assets/models/courthouse.glb`, 13,680 triangles, 12 materials, baked lightmap intensity 1.1979) at (−18.34, 0.15, −6.85): portico front 8.0 m behind the property line, steps reach x −16.69. The code-built placeholder and the lawn path at (−13.05, −7.05) were replaced by a paved concrete forecourt flush with the sidewalk (out to the Court St line), plus 15 cm grade slabs under the body, north wing and jail yard so no wall floats above the lawn. Curb trees at x −7.5 and the county offices placeholder (z ≤ −20.45) clear the model. Tested: no console errors, lightmap reads (no black faces; wing door and entablature fine). Start view (0, 0, 18) facing north: 160 draw calls / 53k triangles (was 149 / 39k); the ~150 call guideline is exceeded mainly by the code-built placeholders, which will drop as they are replaced by GLBs. |
